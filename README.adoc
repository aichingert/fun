This is an advanced implementation of tic-tac-toe which has some special rules.

== Rules

* the board has nine 3x3 boards like the board in the middle
* the boards are connected with each other
* the connections are tied to the previous move
* the first move is freely choosable
* after the first move the second player has to play in the board which has been marked by the first player

== How to run

* dependencies

[source, sh]
----
cargo install protoc-gen-prost protoc-gen-prost-serde protoc-gen-tonic protoc-gen-prost-crate
----

* grpc-web
** you may need to generate the protofiles yourself if I don't figure it out to do it during ng build
** if that is the case you can find in the package.json how to do it

This is still a wip and does not work yet

=== Implementation infos

* Angular 17 works with protobuf-ts

* server architecture
** lobby 
*** has amount of users
*** has rpc method which sends channel informations (amount, new, deleted)

** channel
*** has its a onw rpc service
*** which handels spectators and players

=== Deployment

notes

* nginx has grpc_pass (grpc://...)
* set potential headers
** maybe server sided streaming does not work
* remove the port from the baseUrl in the grpcTransformOptions
